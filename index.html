          Hey! I'm a front-end developer from Toronto, Canada and currently residing in Yokohama, Japan. I graduated from the University of Toronto majoring in Computer Science and Astronomy & Astrophysics.
        </p>
        <div id="description" class="description animated fadeIn">
          <p>
            While most of my previous work has been focused on front-end development, I also have experience in back-end development (using PHP, Java), along with a short stint in scientific computing and research.
          </p>
          <p>
             I am constantly trying to learn new things and am dedicated to the task at hand. Using newly learned tools and strategies to uncover innovative solutions is always satisfying to me, and I also just enjoy creating things.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work and studying, my spare time is taken up with dancing, video games, and going down the YouTube rabbit hole every so often.

            I worked on developing the software needed to investigate the effects of weak gravitational lensing in the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) together with my research group. During my time here I:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://github.com/louis-pham/modified_lenspix">Modified the simulation tool LensPix</a> to read external map files and write the outputs
            </li>
            <li>
              Created Python wrappers and power spectrum plots of the simulations
            </li>
            <li>
              Debugged the modifications and simulations through comparisons with theoretical expectations
            </li>
            <li>
              Wrote documentation for the code along with a final report on the project as a whole
            </li>
            <li>
              Created and gave presentations on the research to fellow researchers and colleagues
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
             By making these changes, we were able to run weak lensing simulations using our own custom maps of the CIB and gravitational maps. With the appropriate maps, the tool can also be used to simulate weak lensing in other background such as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).
          </p>
          <p class="reflection">
            This was my first venture into the world of theoretical astrophysics research - another experience of many firsts, but nonetheless enlightening. It was exciting and fulfilling to interact with people of various research topics, disciplines, and expertise, even though nine times out of ten I was terribly ill-equipped to understand exactly what they were doing.
          </p>
          <p class="reflection">
            It was quite daunting having to poke around some alien (haha) Fortran code, but at least I got to use a supercomputer for the first time - necessary considering how big the maps could get.
          </p>
          <p class="reflection">
            This started off initially as a final-year research course but I was invited by my supervisor to continue with the research over the summer.

            As part of the IT Department, the projects I worked on include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://halloffame.utoronto.ca/">Sports Hall of Fame</a></li>
            <li>Internal tools to aid with scheduling of athletic facilities</li>
            <li>A schedule display to show booked rooms and events at the school's athletic facilities</li>
            <li> Adding extra functionality to the faculty clinic's EMR system (<a href="https://oscar-emr.com/">OSCAR EMR</a>) and overhauling electronic health forms</li>
            <li><a href="https://kpe.utoronto.ca/sports-and-rec">Schedules for various sport and drop-in programs</a></li>
            <li>
              Wayfinder displays to show room locations and events taking place
            </li>
            <li>
              Patient reports generated with database (MySQL) queries
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A majority of the projects were developed using jQuery on the front-end and PHP for the back-end.
          </p>
          <p class="reflection">
            I was always faced with a sense of nervousness working on these projects since they would be visible to a large amount of people whether it be the school's student body or general public - especially for the Hall of Fame website since it was unveiled during the annual induction ceremony. As I was also the only "official coder" on the team, it truly tested my ability to work independently, and I felt there was a huge responsibility for me to do my best.
          </p>
          <p class="reflection">
            In the end, this gave me a new understanding and perspective of the end-user and why it's so important for websites and applications to be easy-to-use and accessible.

            I worked with the Clinical Systems Integration (CSI) team in developing healthcare-related software to be used across the country. Some of the projects I worked on are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              InfoScribe, based off of Atlassian's Confluence, which is an authoring tool catered towards healthcare industry professionals that allows them to effectively document clinical requirements and specifications
            </li>
            <li>
              Mockups of effective <a href="https://infocentral.infoway-inforoute.ca/extra/ca/clinical-requirements/html/start.html">clinical requirements</a> and <a href="https://infocentral.infoway-inforoute.ca/extra/ca/interoperability-spec/html/start.html">specifications</a> - built using AngularJS 1.x
            </li>
            <li>
              HL7 Explorer, a tool also developed with AngularJS to search and display information on the HL7v3 standard (a standard for the exchange of electronic health information)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="reflection">
             My involvement in the full life cycle of these applications gave me a new perspective on this industry as a whole. This was also where I learned the foundations of web development. Being my first experience actually working as developer, I'll always be grateful for the patience of my supervisor and my time here.
          </p>

            This experience was part of my university's internship program.
